# Fecom Inc. CRM analysis
### Project Overview & Business Value
Fecom Inc. is an e‑commerce marketplace with many one‑time buyers. The company wants to reduce churn and stop wasting marketing budget on low‑value customers. This project uses its CRM data to identify which countries and sellers attract customers who return (second orders) and generate the highest lifetime revenue, so Fecom can decide where to cut spending and where to invest more.

Key questions to show in the project
These can be your notebook sections and tell a clear “story” to recruiters:

- Customer acquisition & first orders

- How many new customers per month and per country?

- Which countries/sellers bring the most new customers?​

- Repeat purchase/churn

- What percentage of customers place a second order?

- How long does it take (30, 60, or 90 days), and how does this vary by country and seller?​

- Customer lifetime value (simple)

- What is the average revenue per customer by country and by seller?

- Which segments have high order count but low value, or vice versa?​

- Actionable segments

- Which 3–5 country × seller combinations look like “high churn, low value” → candidates to cut or fix.

BigQuery is used as the main data warehouse and for all heavy transformations; pandas is used in the notebook for quick inspection and visualisation.
